xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

A model of gait is provided to serve as a vehicle for gait data analysis.

== 2 Introduction and Background

== 3 Requirements

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.1 Gait Characteristics

The parameters taken into account for the gait analysis are as follows:

* duration of walk
* cadence
  ** cycle period
  ** min, max, avg period
  ** variability
* speed
  ** min, max, avg speed
  ** variability of speed
* turn time
  ** turn time right
  ** turn time left
  ** asymmetry
* step length
  ** min, max, avg step length right
  ** min, max, avg step length left
  ** asymmetry
* stride length
  ** stride variability
* angular movement (at spine)
  ** min, max, avg angle normal to travel right
  ** min, max, avg angle normal to travel left
  ** asymmetry
* variation from course
